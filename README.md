## Literature Light Map for Causal Inference

This repository is used for replicate cutting edge papers in the filed of causal inference. The excel file ``Literature Light Map`` shows how these papers are inter connected. 

## How to contribute
Add papers you think that pushed the frontier in this area, and built the Literature Light Map together. (With and without replication code are both welcomed!)

## Roadmap
+ Each folder relates to a specific topic.
+ Inside each folder, there are related papers and replication codes.
+ All the data used in these anlysis are stored in the data folder.
+ The reading list contains papers are about to be replicated.
